// --- Write a Program to delete a property from an object?
// In this code, an object obj with properties name and age is created. The delete keyword removes the age property from the object. After deletion, console.log(obj) outputs the object, which now only contains the name property: { name: 'Riya' }.

const obj = { name: "Riya", age: 21 };
delete obj.age;
console.log(obj);
